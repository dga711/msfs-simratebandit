## Features
* Display current SimRate
* Announce current SimRate via voice on change
* Automatic SimRate increase/decrease until final waypoint of flight plan is reached (description below)
* ...

Come back or "Star" the repo for future updates.

### Automatic SimRate
When you click the "Start Travel" button the SimRate will automatically increase and decrease when the final waypoint is reached

Best use this when you departed and autopilot and speeds are set.

The conditions for auto travel to automatically stop are currently:
* 15nm before final waypoint in flight plan (before approach)
* 25nm before final waypoint on direct flights
* Approach activated

Depending on cross track error and distance to the next waypoint, the SimRate will decrease to allow the autopilot to properly adjust heading. SimRate will increase after the waypoint again.

## Usage
Download or clone the app and start. When the sim is loaded press "Connect".
